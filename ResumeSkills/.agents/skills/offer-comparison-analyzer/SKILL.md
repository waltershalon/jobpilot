## Weighted Decision Matrix

### Step 1: Define Your Priorities

```
Factor                  Weight
------------------------------------
Total Compensation       25%
Career Growth            25%
Work-Life Balance        20%
Team & Culture           20%
Location/Commute         10%
------------------------------------
Total:                   100%
```

### Step 2: Score Each Factor

```
                    Company A   Company B
Factor              Score (1-10)
------------------------------------
Compensation        7           8
Career Growth       7           8
Work-Life           8           6
Team & Culture      9           7
Location            8           5
```

### Step 3: Calculate Weighted Score

```
Company A:
(7 × 0.25) + (7 × 0.25) + (8 × 0.20) + (9 × 0.20) + (8 × 0.10)
= 1.75 + 1.75 + 1.60 + 1.80 + 0.80
= 7.70

Company B:
(8 × 0.25) + (8 × 0.25) + (6 × 0.20) + (7 × 0.20) + (5 × 0.10)
= 2.00 + 2.00 + 1.20 + 1.40 + 0.50
= 7.10

Result: Company A scores higher (7.70 vs 7.10)
```
