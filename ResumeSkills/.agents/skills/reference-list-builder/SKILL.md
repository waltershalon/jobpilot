### Who Makes a Good Reference?

- Cross-functional partners
- Clients or customers
- Direct reports (for leadership roles)
- Professors or advisors (for recent graduates)

**Reference Hierarchy:**
1. **Most Valuable:** Recent direct supervisor
2. **Very Valuable:** Senior leaders who know your work
3. **Valuable:** Peers and cross-functional partners
4. **Acceptable:** Clients, vendors, professors
5. **Avoid:** Friends, family, HR contacts only

### Who to Avoid

- ❌ Current employer (without permission)
- ❌ People who barely know you
- ❌ References from 10+ years ago only
- ❌ Personal friends (unless specified)
- ❌ People who might give lukewarm feedback
- ❌ Anyone you haven't contacted in advance

## Reference List Format

### Standard Format

**Required:**
- Full name
- Current job title
- Current company
- Phone number
- Professional email
- Your relationship to them

**Optional:**
- LinkedIn URL
- Best time to reach
- Preferred contact method

### Formatting Guidelines

- Match the style of your resume (fonts, formatting)
- 3-5 references (more only if requested)
- Separate page from resume
- Header should match resume header
- Include "References" or "Professional References" as title

## Reference Preparation

### Step 1: Ask Permission

**Before listing anyone:**
- Call or email to ask permission
- Confirm their contact information
- Explain the role you're applying for
- Gauge their willingness and enthusiasm

**Script:**
```
"Hi [Name], I hope you're doing well! I'm applying for a [Role] position at [Company] and was wondering if you'd be comfortable serving as a reference for me. The role involves [brief description], and I think your perspective on [specific project/skill] would be particularly valuable. Would you be willing to speak with them if they reach out?"
```

### Step 2: Brief Your References

**Send them:**
- Copy of your resume
- Job description
- Key points you want highlighted
- Specific projects to mention
- Timeline for when they might be contacted

**Briefing Email Template:**
```
Subject: Reference Preparation - [Role] at [Company]

Hi [Name],

Thank you so much for agreeing to be a reference! Here's some context to help:

**The Role:** [Job title] at [Company]
**What they're looking for:** [Key requirements]

**Points I'm emphasizing:**
- [Achievement 1]
- [Achievement 2]
- [Skill they should mention]

**Our work together they might ask about:**
- [Project 1]
- [Project 2]

I've attached my resume and the job description for reference. They may reach out in the next [timeframe].

Please let me know if you have any questions, and thank you again!

Best,
[Your name]
```

### Step 3: Follow Up

After references are checked:
- Thank your references regardless of outcome
- Let them know the result
- Offer to reciprocate

## Handling Special Situations

### Current Employer Doesn't Know

**Options:**
- Ask if reference check can wait until later stage
- Use colleagues who've left the company
- Be upfront: "My current employer doesn't know I'm looking"
- Use other professional references

### Manager Left the Company

**Options:**
- Track them down on LinkedIn
- Use their personal email/phone
- Include their new company in reference list
- Explain "Former manager, now at [New Company]"

### Bad Relationship with Past Manager

**Options:**
- Use another supervisor from that role
- Use senior colleagues instead
- Choose references from different roles
- Be prepared to explain if asked

### Limited Professional Experience

**Options:**
- Professors or academic advisors
- Internship supervisors
- Volunteer organization leaders
- Coaches or mentors
- Client contacts

### Reference Won't Give Positive Review

**Don't use them.** It's better to have fewer references than a lukewarm or negative one.

## What Reference Checkers Ask

### Common Questions

**Performance:**
- "How would you describe [name]'s work?"
- "What were their primary responsibilities?"
- "How did they perform against expectations?"

**Skills:**
- "What are their greatest strengths?"
- "What areas could they improve?"
- "How would you rate their [specific skill]?"

**Work Style:**
- "How did they handle pressure/deadlines?"
- "How did they work with the team?"
- "How did they handle conflict?"

**Character:**
- "Would you rehire them?"
- "Is there anything else I should know?"
- "How do they compare to peers?"

### The "Would You Rehire?" Question

**Most important question.** Brief your references that this may be asked and ensure they can answer enthusiastically.

## Reference Timing

### When to Provide References

- **Don't include with initial application** (unless requested)
- **Bring to interview** (have them ready)
- **Provide when asked** (usually after final interview)
- **Always ask before sharing** (confirm permission each time)

### Common Timeline

1. **Application:** "References available upon request" (optional on resume)
2. **First Interview:** Have list ready but don't offer
3. **Final Rounds:** "Can you provide references?" → Share list
4. **Reference Check:** Company contacts your references
5. **Offer:** Follow up with references, thank them

## Output Format

When building a reference list:

```markdown
