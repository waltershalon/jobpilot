## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user:
- Wants to create portfolio case studies
- Needs to expand resume bullets into detailed writeups
- Is building a portfolio website
- Wants to showcase project work in depth
- Mentions: "case study", "portfolio", "project writeup", "work samples", "portfolio piece"

## Core Capabilities

- Transform resume bullets into detailed case studies
- Structure case studies for maximum impact
- Create compelling project narratives
- Balance technical detail with business context
- Format for portfolio websites
- Tailor depth to audience

## Case Study Purpose

**Why Case Studies Matter:**
- Resumes show WHAT you did; case studies show HOW and WHY
- Demonstrate thinking process, not just outcomes
- Allow deeper showcase of skills
- Differentiate you from other candidates
- Required for many PM, UX, and creative roles

## The Case Study Structure

### Standard Structure

```
1. Overview (Project summary)
2. Problem (What needed to be solved)
3. Process (How you approached it)
4. Solution (What you created/delivered)
5. Results (The impact)
6. Learnings (What you'd do differently)
```

### Time to Read
- **Quick Read:** 3-5 minutes (essential for portfolio)
- **Deep Dive:** 10-15 minutes (for interested readers)

## Section-by-Section Guide

### 1. Overview Section

**Purpose:** Hook the reader, provide context

**Include:**
- Project name and company
- Your role
- Timeline
- Team size
- One-sentence summary of impact

**Example:**
```
# Redesigning the Checkout Flow

**Company:** E-Commerce Inc.
**Role:** Lead Product Designer
**Timeline:** 6 weeks
**Team:** 2 designers, 3 engineers, 1 PM

**Summary:** Reduced cart abandonment by 35% through a streamlined 3-step checkout process, generating $2M in recovered revenue.
```

### 2. Problem Section

**Purpose:** Set up why this work mattered

**Include:**
- Business context
- User pain points
- Key metrics or goals
- Constraints

**Example:**
```
## The Problem

E-Commerce Inc. was experiencing 68% cart abandonment—significantly higher than the industry average of 55%. Exit surveys and user research revealed several issues:

- **Too many steps:** Our checkout had 7 screens
- **Forced account creation:** Users had to register before purchasing
- **Hidden costs:** Shipping wasn't shown until step 5
- **Mobile friction:** Forms weren't optimized for mobile

**Goal:** Reduce cart abandonment to below 50% within 3 months.

**Constraints:**
- No changes to existing payment integrations
- Had to maintain PCI compliance
- 6-week timeline before holiday season
```

### 3. Process Section

**Purpose:** Show your thinking and methodology

**Include:**
- Research conducted
- Stakeholders involved
- Hypotheses formed
- Options considered
- Decisions made (and why)

**Example:**
```
## Process

### Research
I started by understanding the problem deeply:
- Analyzed Mixpanel funnel data for drop-off points
- Conducted 10 user interviews with recent abandoners
- Reviewed heatmaps and session recordings
- Benchmarked against 5 competitor checkout flows

**Key Insight:** 73% of drop-offs occurred at the account creation screen. Users wanted to purchase, not commit to a relationship.

### Ideation
I explored several approaches:
1. Guest checkout only (simplest)
2. Social login options (lower friction)
3. Progressive profiling (collect info over time)
4. One-page checkout (Amazon-style)

After weighing feasibility, timeline, and impact, we chose a hybrid approach...

### Decisions Made
- **Guest checkout first:** Made registration optional and post-purchase
- **Transparent pricing:** Showed shipping on the first screen
- **Mobile-first design:** Designed for mobile, then adapted for desktop
- **Progress indicator:** Added clear "Step 1 of 3" indicator
```

### 4. Solution Section

**Purpose:** Show what you actually created

**Include:**
- Visual artifacts (mockups, screenshots, diagrams)
- Key features/changes
- Technical implementation (if relevant)
- How it addressed the problems

**Example:**
```
## Solution

### The New Checkout Flow

**Before:** 7 screens with mandatory registration
**After:** 3 screens with optional guest checkout

### Key Changes

**1. Transparent Pricing Widget**

Showed order total, shipping, and taxes from the start. No surprises.

**2. Guest Checkout Option**

Made account creation optional with clear value proposition for why to register.

**3. Smart Form Design**

- Single-column layout on mobile
- Auto-format for phone/card numbers
- Address autocomplete integration
- Clear error messaging

**4. Trust Signals**
Added security badges, money-back guarantee, and customer service contact throughout the flow.
```

### 5. Results Section

**Purpose:** Prove impact with data

**Include:**
- Quantitative results (with timeframe)
- Comparison to goals
- Secondary metrics affected
- Business impact

**Example:**
```
## Results

### Primary Metrics (90 days post-launch)

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Cart Abandonment | 68% | 44% | -35% |
| Checkout Completion | 32% | 56% | +75% |
| Mobile Conversion | 18% | 41% | +128% |
| Revenue per Visitor | $2.40 | $3.85 | +60% |

### Business Impact
- **$2M additional revenue** in first quarter
- **15% increase in mobile orders**
- **Customer support tickets about checkout** dropped by 45%

### Secondary Effects
- Account creation actually increased 20% (post-purchase)
- Average order value stayed stable
- Return customer rate improved
```

### 6. Learnings Section

**Purpose:** Show growth mindset and self-awareness

**Include:**
- What worked well
- What you'd do differently
- Unexpected challenges
- Skills developed

**Example:**
```
## Learnings

### What Worked
- **Early user research** prevented us from building the wrong solution
- **Cross-functional alignment** meetings kept everyone on the same page
- **Launching with analytics** let us measure impact immediately

### What I'd Do Differently
- **More A/B testing:** We launched the full redesign at once. Would have preferred to test individual changes to understand what drove results.
- **Earlier mobile focus:** We designed desktop-first then adapted. Starting mobile-first would have been more efficient.
- **Stakeholder education:** Spent too long convincing leadership. Would start stakeholder alignment earlier next time.

### Skills Developed
- Advanced Figma prototyping
- Working with A/B testing frameworks
- Presenting data-driven design decisions to executives
