**[Leadership Action] + [Strategic Initiative] + [Business Outcome at Scale]**

### Key Elements for Executive Experience

- P&L or budget responsibility

**Metrics to Emphasize:**

```

## Executive-Specific Considerations

### Emphasize Transformation

Executives are hired to **transform**, not maintain. Show:
- What changed because of you
- Before/after states
- Scale of impact

**Transformation Story Formula:**
"Inherited [situation]. Implemented [strategic change]. Achieved [outcome]."

### Show Leadership Philosophy

Unlike individual contributor resumes, executive resumes should hint at **how** you lead.

**Examples:**
- "Known for building consensus across diverse stakeholder groups"
- "Leads with data-driven decision making while maintaining strategic flexibility"
- "Champions innovation while maintaining operational discipline"

### Handle Tenure Carefully

**Short Tenures:** Frame around specific missions
- "Brought in to lead post-merger integration"
- "Recruited for turnaround; completed in 18 months"
- "Joined to prepare company for acquisition"

**Long Tenures:** Show progression and reinvention
- "Promoted through 4 roles over 12 years"
- "Led multiple transformations as company grew from $50M to $500M"

### Confidential Information

**Do:**
- Use percentage improvements when absolutes are confidential
- Use ranges for revenue/headcount
- Speak to relative impact

**Don't:**
- Share proprietary strategies
- Name confidential acquisition targets
- Reveal undisclosed financial information

## Executive Resume Tone

### Power Language for Executives

**Strategic Action Verbs:**
- Spearheaded, Orchestrated, Championed, Steered
- Transformed, Revolutionized, Pioneered
- Architected, Engineered (strategically)
- Drove, Accelerated, Catalyzed

**Leadership Language:**
- "Led organization through..."
- "Built and scaled..."
- "Established vision for..."
- "Negotiated and secured..."
- "Championed transformation..."

### What to Avoid

- ❌ Tactical/operational language (managed, handled, assisted)
- ❌ First person pronouns (I, my, me)
- ❌ Jargon without context
- ❌ Generic statements without proof
- ❌ Too much humility (take credit appropriately)
