### Example STAR Story

**Question:** "Tell me about a time you led a team through a difficult project."

**Answer:**
```
SITUATION: "At TechCorp, our main product was losing customers to a competitor who had launched a better mobile experience. We were seeing 5% monthly churn, up from our normal 2%."

TASK: "As the product manager, I was responsible for turning around our mobile product to stop the bleeding and win back customers."

ACTION: "I started by interviewing 30 churned customers to understand exactly why they left. Based on that research, I prioritized 5 critical features that would achieve parity with competitors. I then worked with engineering to restructure our roadmap, negotiated with leadership to add 2 contract developers, and implemented weekly sprint reviews to keep the project on track. I also started a beta program with 50 of our best customers to get feedback before full launch."

RESULT: "We launched the improved mobile app in 3 months, reducing churn from 5% back to 2% within 60 days. We recovered 35% of churned customers and the NPS for our mobile app increased from 32 to 58. This project was recognized in our company all-hands as a turnaround success."

- "What are the biggest challenges facing the team?"
- "How is performance measured?"
- "What's the team structure?"

### For Team Members
- "What's a typical day/week like?"
- "What do you enjoy most about working here?"
- "How do teams collaborate?"
- "What would you want a new hire to know?"

### For Executives
- "What's the company's strategy for the next year?"
- "How does this team contribute to company goals?"
- "What keeps you excited about the company?"

### To Avoid
- ❌ Questions about salary/benefits (save for HR)
- ❌ Questions you could easily Google
- ❌ Negative questions about company problems
- ❌ Yes/no questions (ask open-ended)

## Handling Difficult Questions

### "What's your greatest weakness?"

**Formula:** Real weakness + Self-awareness + Improvement steps

```
"I tend to be overly detail-oriented, which can sometimes slow me down. I've recognized this and now set time limits for tasks and ask for feedback on when good enough is good enough. In my current role, I've also learned to delegate detailed work when appropriate."
```

### "Why are you leaving your current job?"

**Keep it:**
- Positive (growth-focused)
- Forward-looking (not complaint-based)
- Brief (don't over-explain)

```
"I've learned a lot at [Company], but I'm looking for [specific opportunity] that I don't see available in my current path. This role at [Company] offers exactly that - the chance to [specific thing]."
```

### "Tell me about a time you failed"

**Must include:**
- Real failure (not humble brag)
- What you learned
- How you applied the learning

```
"In my first year as a PM, I launched a feature without sufficient user research. The feature was technically sound but users found it confusing. Only 10% adopted it. I learned the hard way that building the right thing matters more than building the thing right. Since then, I never skip user research - I now always do at least 10 user interviews before major feature decisions."
```

### Salary Questions

**Deflect until you have to answer:**

```
"I'm flexible on compensation and more focused on finding the right role. Can you share the range budgeted for this position?"
```

**If pressed:**
```
"Based on my research and experience, I'm looking for something in the range of $X-$Y, but I'm open to discussing the full compensation package."
```
