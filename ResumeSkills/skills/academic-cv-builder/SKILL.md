## CV Length Guidelines

| Career Stage | Expected Length |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Graduate Student | 2-4 pages |
| Postdoc | 3-6 pages |
| Early Career Faculty | 5-10 pages |
| Mid-Career Faculty | 10-20 pages |
| Senior Faculty | 15-30+ pages |

**Rule:** Your CV grows throughout your career. Don't pad, but don't artificially constrain length.
