# Creative Portfolio Resume

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user:
- Works in a creative field (design, marketing, writing)
- Needs to balance visual design with ATS compatibility
- Wants to showcase creative skills through resume design
- Is building a portfolio resume for creative roles
- Mentions: "creative resume", "designer resume", "visual resume", "portfolio resume", "creative field"

## Core Capabilities

- Guide visual hierarchy and design choices
- Connect resume to portfolio effectively

## The Creative Resume Dilemma

**The Problem:**
- Creative professionals want to show design skills through their resume
- But most applications go through ATS systems
- Overly designed resumes often fail ATS parsing

**The Solution:**
Two-version approach:
1. **ATS-compatible version** for online applications
2. **Designed version** for portfolio, networking, direct submissions

## When to Use Each Version

### Use ATS-Compatible Version When:
- Applying through online portals
- Submitting to job boards
- Resume will be parsed by software
- You're unsure how it will be processed

### Use Designed Version When:
- Networking events
- Direct email to hiring manager
- Portfolio website
- In-person interviews
- Creative agencies that expect visual resumes
- When specifically told ATS isn't used

## ATS-Compatible Creative Resume

Even the ATS version can show creativity through:

### Subtle Design Elements
- Strategic use of white space
- Clean typography hierarchy
- Thoughtful content organization
- Strong copywriting
- Polished, professional appearance

### Safe Creative Touches
- ✅ Custom professional font (ATS-safe ones)
- ✅ Strategic bold and italic
- ✅ Clean section dividers (simple lines)
- ✅ Consistent, intentional spacing
- ✅ Color in your name/headers (sparing)
- ✅ Hyperlinks to portfolio

### Still Avoid
- ❌ Multiple columns
- ❌ Text boxes
- ❌ Images or icons
- ❌ Tables for layout
- ❌ Unusual fonts
- ❌ Graphics or skill bars
