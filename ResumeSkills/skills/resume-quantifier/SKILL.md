# Resume Quantifier

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user:
- Needs to add metrics and numbers to their resume
- Has bullets without quantifiable results
- Doesn't know what numbers to include
- Says they "don't have metrics" or "can't measure impact"
- Mentions: "add metrics", "quantify", "add numbers", "measure impact", "no data"

## Core Capabilities

- Find hidden metrics in any experience
- Estimate numbers when exact data unavailable
- Create before/after comparisons
- Identify measurable impact points
- Transform vague statements into quantified achievements
- Guide users to discover their metrics

## Why Quantification Matters

**The Problem:**
- "Managed projects" vs "Managed 12 projects worth $2M"
- "Improved processes" vs "Reduced cycle time by 40%"
- "Helped customers" vs "Resolved 50+ tickets daily with 98% satisfaction"

**Studies Show:**
- Resumes with numbers get 30% more attention
- Quantified bullets are 40% more memorable
- Numbers provide credibility and scale

## The Quantification Framework

### Categories of Metrics

**1. Money**
- Revenue generated
- Costs reduced/saved
- Budget managed
- Deal sizes closed
- Profit margins improved

**2. Time**
- Hours saved
- Cycle time reduced
- Project duration
- Response times
- Time to market

**3. Percentages**
- Growth rates
- Improvement percentages
- Efficiency gains
- Error reduction
- Conversion rates

**4. Volume/Scale**
- Number of customers/users
- Projects managed
- Team size
- Transactions processed
- Items produced

**5. Quality**
- Satisfaction scores
- Error rates
- Accuracy rates
- Compliance rates
- SLA adherence

**6. Frequency**
- Per day/week/month
- Annual totals
- Meeting cadences
- Report cycles

## Finding Hidden Metrics

### The Discovery Questions

For any experience, ask:

**Scale Questions:**
- How many people/projects/customers?
- What was the budget/revenue involved?
- How large was the team?
- How many locations/regions?

**Impact Questions:**
- What changed because of your work?
- What would have happened without you?
- What problems did you solve?
- What got better/faster/cheaper?

**Comparison Questions:**
- How was it before vs. after?
- How did you compare to others/previous results?
- What was the baseline you improved?

### Role-Specific Metric Discovery

- NPS score contribution

**Operations:**
- Efficiency improvements
- Cost reductions
- Process cycle times
- Error rate reductions
- Throughput increases

**Engineering:**
- System uptime
- Performance improvements
- Bug resolution rate
- Deployment frequency
- Code coverage

**Project Management:**
- Number of projects
- Budget sizes

**HR/Admin:**
- Hiring numbers
- Time to fill
- Employee satisfaction scores
- Training completion rates
- Onboarding efficiency

## Estimation Techniques

When you don't have exact numbers:

### Conservative Estimation

**Principle:** Estimate low to maintain credibility

**Example:**
- You think you saved 100 hours/month → say "75+ hours"
- You think growth was 50% → say "~40%"
- You think you served 500 customers → say "400+"

### Range Estimation

**Format:** "X-Y" or "X to Y"

**Examples:**
- "Managed team of 8-12"
- "Generated $100K-$150K in revenue"
- "Saved 20-30 hours weekly"

### Minimum Bound

**Format:** "X+" or "at least X"

**Examples:**
- "Served 100+ customers daily"
- "Managed at least 15 concurrent projects"
- "Generated $500K+ in annual revenue"

### Percentage of Activity

**Format:** Calculate from known totals

**Example:**
- Company had 1000 customers → You managed 20% → "Managed 200 customer accounts"
- Team had 10 people → You supervised 4 → "Supervised 40% of team"

### Time-Based Calculation

**Format:** Work backwards from frequency

**Example:**
- Met with 5 clients/week × 50 weeks = "Consulted with 250+ clients annually"
- Processed 30 invoices/day × 250 days = "Processed 7,500+ invoices annually"

## Quantification Templates

### Before and After Template
```
"Improved [X] from [before number] to [after number], resulting in [Y]% improvement"

Example:
"Improved page load time from 8 seconds to 2 seconds, resulting in 75% reduction and 20% increase in user engagement"
```

### Scale Template
```
"[Verb] [number] [things], resulting in [impact]"

Example:
"Managed 25 concurrent projects worth $3M, delivering 95% on-time with zero budget overruns"
```

### Volume + Impact Template
```
"Processed [number] [items] per [time period], achieving [quality metric]"

Example:
"Resolved 50+ customer tickets daily, maintaining 98% satisfaction rating and 4-hour average response time"
```

### Comparison Template
```
"Ranked #[X] out of [Y] in [metric], [context]"

Example:
"Ranked #2 out of 45 sales representatives nationally, generating $3.2M in annual revenue"
```

## Common "I Have No Numbers" Situations

### Situation 1: "I was just one person on a team"

**Solution:** Focus on YOUR contribution

**Example:**
- "Part of team that launched product" →
- "Contributed 40% of front-end code for product launch reaching 100K users"

### Situation 2: "I don't have access to business metrics"

**Solution:** Quantify activities and inputs

**Example:**
- "Supported sales team" →
- "Created 50+ sales presentations and managed pipeline of 200+ prospects in Salesforce"

### Situation 3: "My job didn't produce measurable outcomes"

**Solution:** Measure the work itself

**Example:**
- "Wrote documentation" →
- "Produced 75-page technical documentation reducing new hire onboarding time by 2 weeks"

### Situation 4: "Results were confidential"

**Solution:** Use percentages or ranges

**Example:**
- "Increased revenue" →
- "Grew revenue by 40%+ year-over-year" or "Contributed to $X-$Y million growth"

### Situation 5: "I was entry-level with limited impact"

**Solution:** Quantify learning, throughput, accuracy

**Example:**
- "Entered data" →
- "Processed 200+ records daily with 99.5% accuracy rate, exceeding team average by 15%"

## Output Format

When quantifying a resume:

```markdown
# RESUME QUANTIFICATION

## Analysis Summary
**Bullets without numbers:** X
**Bullets with numbers:** Y
**Target:** 100% of bullets should have at least one metric

## Quantified Bullets

### Original Bullet #1:
"Managed customer accounts"

### Questions to Find Metrics:
- How many accounts? → [User answer: ~40]
- What was the revenue? → [User answer: ~$2M]
- What results did you achieve? → [User answer: retained most]

### Quantified Version:
"Managed portfolio of 40 enterprise accounts representing $2M ARR, achieving 95% retention rate"

### Metrics Added:
- Account count: 40
- Revenue: $2M ARR
- Retention: 95%

### Original Bullet #2:
[Continue for each bullet]

## Estimation Notes
- [Metric]: Estimated based on [reasoning]
- [Metric]: Conservative estimate using [method]

## Remaining Questions
- [Questions to ask user for missing information]
```

## Quantification Quality Checklist

For each bullet:
- ✅ Has at least ONE number
- ✅ Number is relevant (not just any number)
- ✅ Scale is clear (what does the number mean?)
- ✅ Estimation is conservative and defensible
- ✅ Number adds credibility, not confusion
- ✅ You can explain the number in an interview

## Numbers to Avoid

- ❌ Numbers that make you look bad
- ❌ Numbers you can't explain or defend
- ❌ Numbers that reveal confidential information
- ❌ Exaggerated or inflated numbers
- ❌ Numbers without context (e.g., "increased by 300%" without baseline)
- ❌ Too many numbers in one bullet (2-3 max)

## Key Principle

**Every bullet can be quantified.** If you think your work can't be measured, you haven't asked the right questions yet.

The goal isn't to have impressive numbers—it's to have SPECIFIC numbers that show the scope and impact of your work.
