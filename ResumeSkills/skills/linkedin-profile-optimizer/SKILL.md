### 3. Headline (Most Important for Searchability)

**Formula:** [Role] | [Key Expertise] | [Value Proposition]

**Examples:**

❌ **Weak Headlines:**

✅ **Strong Headlines:**
```
Senior Product Manager | B2B SaaS | Driving 0→1 Products from Concept to $10M ARR

- Industry terms
- Certifications

### 4. About Section (Summary)

```
