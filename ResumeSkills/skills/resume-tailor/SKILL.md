# Resume Tailor

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user wants to:
- Customize their resume for a specific job posting
- Adjust their resume to match job requirements
- Create a targeted version of their resume
- Mentions: "tailor resume", "customize resume", "target role", "specific job", "match job description"

Use AFTER job-description-analyzer to know what to emphasize.

## Core Capabilities

- Reorder experience sections by relevance to target role
- Adjust professional summary for specific position
- Add missing keywords from job description
- Modify bullet points to match job requirements
- Maintain authenticity while optimizing match
- Create multiple targeted resume versions

## The Tailoring Philosophy

**Key Principle:** You're not lying or fabricating - you're HIGHLIGHTING the most relevant parts of your true experience.

Think of your full experience as a library of achievements. Tailoring means selecting the books that best fit what each employer is looking for.

## Tailoring Process

### Step 1: Analyze the Job (Use Job Description Analyzer First)
- Identify required skills and keywords
- Note the company's priorities
- Understand the role's primary responsibilities

### Step 2: Audit Your Resume
For each section, ask:
- Does this support my candidacy for THIS specific role?
- Is there a better way to phrase this for THIS job?
- Should this be higher or lower in priority?

### Step 3: Make Strategic Adjustments

**Professional Summary:** Rewrite to mirror the job's key requirements

**Skills Section:** Reorder to put most relevant skills first, add missing keywords

**Experience:** 
- Reorder jobs if a less recent role is more relevant
- Swap bullet points to lead with most relevant achievements
- Add keywords naturally into existing bullets

**Education:** Highlight relevant coursework, certifications

## Section-by-Section Tailoring Guide

### Professional Summary

This is your "elevator pitch" - customize for each application.

**Generic Summary (AVOID):**
```
Results-driven professional with 5 years of experience in business operations. Strong analytical and communication skills. Looking for a challenging opportunity to grow.
```

**Tailored for Operations Manager Role:**
```
Operations Manager with 5 years optimizing supply chain processes and reducing costs by 25%. Expertise in Lean Six Sigma, vendor management, and cross-functional team leadership. Track record of improving operational efficiency while maintaining quality standards.
```

**Tailored for Project Manager Role (Same Person):**
```
Project Manager with 5 years leading cross-functional initiatives from concept to delivery. PMP-certified with expertise in Agile methodology, stakeholder management, and budget oversight. Track record of on-time, under-budget project delivery across $10M+ portfolios.
```

### Skills Section Reordering

**Job Description Emphasizes:** Data analysis, SQL, Python, stakeholder communication

**Before (Generic Order):**
```
Skills: Microsoft Office, Communication, Project Management, Python, SQL, Data Visualization, Leadership
```

**After (Tailored Order):**
```
Skills: SQL, Python, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Stakeholder Communication, Project Management, Microsoft Office
```

### Experience Section

**Strategy 1: Reorder Jobs**

If your most recent job is less relevant than a previous role:

**Before:**
1. Marketing Coordinator (current, but applying for data role)
2. Data Analyst (previous, highly relevant)

**After:**
1. Data Analyst (labeled with dates, moved up)
2. Marketing Coordinator (still included, but secondary)

**Strategy 2: Swap Bullet Order**

Lead with bullets most relevant to the target role.

**Applying for Management Role - Lead with:**
- "Led team of 12..."
- "Managed budget of $2M..."

**Applying for Technical Role - Lead with:**
- "Developed automated system..."
- "Analyzed 500K+ data points..."

**Strategy 3: Adjust Bullet Language**

Incorporate job description keywords while staying truthful.

**Job Description Says:** "stakeholder management"
**Your Bullet Says:** "Worked with various teams"
**Tailored Version:** "Managed stakeholder relationships across 5 departments, ensuring alignment on project priorities"

## Tailoring Templates

### For Each Job Application, Create:

```markdown
## RESUME TAILORING PLAN

**Target Position:** [Job Title]
**Company:** [Company Name]
**Match Score:** [From JD Analyzer]

**Current:** [Your current summary]
**Tailored:** [Rewritten for this role]

### Skills Reordering
**Current Order:** [List]
**New Order:** [Reordered list with added keywords]

**Job 2: [Title]**
[Same structure]

### Other Adjustments

```

## Common Tailoring Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Technical Role at Non-Tech Company

**Challenge:** They want technical skills but also business acumen

**Strategy:**
- Lead with technical achievements
- Include business impact in every technical bullet
- Add "translated technical concepts for business stakeholders"

### Scenario 2: Management Role (But You've Done Both IC and Management)

**Challenge:** Show leadership without abandoning technical credibility

**Strategy:**
- Summary: Emphasize leadership
- Experience: Lead with team management bullets
- Keep some technical bullets to show you understand the work

### Scenario 3: Startup (But You've Worked at Big Companies)

**Challenge:** Show you can thrive in ambiguity and wear many hats

**Strategy:**
- Highlight cross-functional work
- Emphasize initiative and self-starting
- Show scrappy, creative problem-solving
- De-emphasize rigid processes and large team structures

### Scenario 4: Big Company (But You've Worked at Startups)

**Challenge:** Show you can work within structure and at scale

**Strategy:**
- Emphasize process improvement
- Highlight work that scaled
- Show collaboration across teams
- Add metrics that show impact at scale

## Keyword Integration Rules

### DO:
- Add keywords that truthfully describe your work
- Use exact phrasing from job description when accurate
- Place keywords naturally in context
- Include keywords in multiple locations (summary, skills, experience)

### DON'T:
- Add skills you don't actually have
- Keyword stuff (repeating same term 10x)
- Create a different meaning than your actual experience
- Sacrifice readability for keyword density

## Truth vs. Tailoring Line

**Acceptable Tailoring:**
- Reordering true information
- Emphasizing relevant experience
- Using industry-standard terminology
- Adding context to vague statements
- Matching language style to job description

**Unacceptable (Lying):**
- Adding skills you don't have
- Changing numbers or metrics
- Creating fake experiences
- Claiming titles you didn't hold
- Stating certifications you don't have

## Version Management

### Maintain a Master Resume
- Keep ONE complete document with ALL experiences
- Include every bullet you've ever written
- This is your "source of truth"

### Create Targeted Versions
- Name files clearly: "JohnSmith_Resume_ProductManager_TechCorp.pdf"
- Track which version went to which company
- Save tailoring notes for interview prep

### Version Naming Convention
```
[LastName]_Resume_[TargetRole]_[Company]_[Date].pdf

Examples:
- Smith_Resume_PM_Google_Jan2024.pdf
- Smith_Resume_DataAnalyst_Meta_Jan2024.pdf
- Smith_Resume_General_Master.docx (your master file)
```
