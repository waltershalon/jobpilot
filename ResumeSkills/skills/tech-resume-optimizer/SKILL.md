**Project READMEs should include:**
- What the project does
- Technologies used
- How to run it
- Screenshots/demos
- Your contributions (for collaborative projects)

### Dealing with Tech Stacks

**If you match their stack:**
- Lead with those technologies
- Quantify your experience with them

**If you don't match exactly:**
- Emphasize transferable skills
- Show learning ability
- Highlight similar technologies
- Example: "Django" → "Extensive Python web framework experience (Django); quick to ramp on new frameworks"

### Technical Interviews Prep Note

Tech resumes should support your interview:
- Only claim technologies you can discuss deeply
- Be ready to explain every project listed
- Know the architecture of systems you've built
- Have stories ready for each bullet
